This condition disrupts plant growth by limiting root respiration and nutrient uptake, reduces agricultural productivity, damages urban infrastructure, and increases the risk of waterborne diseases. Prolonged waterlogging can also harm ecosystems by reducing biodiversity and altering soil structure. Solutions include implementing efficient drainage systems, adopting sustainable urban planning with permeable surfaces and green spaces, and employing agricultural techniques like raised beds and subsurface drainage. Addressing waterlogging requires a combination of infrastructure improvements, environmental conservation, and innovative land management practices.\n",
